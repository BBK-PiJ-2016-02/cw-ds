Going forward make appropriate use of packages for the specifications, implementations,

Good set of tests. Obviously make use of unit testing going forward.

If the interfaces provide javadoc then you should reference them in the implementations
using something like "@see". Also, you should provide internal comments (where
appropriate) to assist the person reading you code.

SampleableList - try and avoid "magic numbers" by the use of appropriate constants.

ize(); i += 2) {

A good attempt.
